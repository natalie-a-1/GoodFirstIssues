## 🚀 Why this matters

The blockchain space thrives on **open collaboration**. Yet, newcomers often struggle to find a welcoming starting point. By surfacing "good first issues" from dozens of repositories, this project:

1. **Democratises opportunity** — anyone can contribute, regardless of experience or background.
2. **Accelerates learning** — tackling real issues beats any tutorial or course.
3. **Strengthens projects** — maintainers receive fresh perspectives & energy.
4. **Builds community** — contributions create bonds that last well beyond a single pull-request.

> Small PRs today → Massive protocol upgrades tomorrow.
