## 🤔 Why this matters

The blockchain space thrives on **open collaboration**. Yet, newcomers often struggle to find a welcoming starting point. By surfacing "good first issues" from dozens of repositories, this project:

1. **Democratises opportunity** — anyone can contribute, regardless of experience or background.
2. **Accelerates learning** — tackling real issues beats any tutorial or course.
3. **Strengthens projects** — maintainers receive fresh perspectives & energy.
4. **Builds community** — contributions create bonds that last well beyond a single pull-request.

> Small PRs today → Massive protocol upgrades tomorrow.

## 🏁 Quick Start (devs at heart)

```bash
pnpm install        # grab dependencies
pnpm dev            # local server on http://localhost:3000
```

Then open the site, pick an issue, and start coding! 💻✨

To refresh the issue list:

```bash
pnpm run update-issues
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. To deploy:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the repository on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
3. Connect a Vercel KV store to your project for storing fetched issues and timestamps.
4. Vercel will automatically detect the Next.js configuration.
5. Your site will be deployed and available at your Vercel URL.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in your Vercel project (Settings > Environment Variables):

- `CRON_SECRET`: A secret key you generate to secure the cron job API endpoint. This is used in the `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: (Optional, but Recommended) A GitHub personal access token to increase rate limits when fetching issues from the GitHub API.
- Vercel KV Environment Variables: When you connect a Vercel KV store, Vercel will automatically add the necessary KV store connection variables (e.g., `KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`).

## Cron Job

This project includes a cron job that automatically updates the GitHub issues. The cron job:
1. Is configured in `vercel.json` to run on a schedule (e.g., daily).
2. Calls the `/api/cron/update-issues` endpoint.
3. Fetches the latest 'good first issues' from various repositories using the GitHub API.
4. Saves the fetched issues to a Vercel KV store (key: `all_issues_data`).
5. Saves the update timestamp to Vercel KV (key: `last_cron_update_timestamp`).

The API route `/api/get-issues` retrieves the issues from Vercel KV for display on the frontend.
The API route `/api/get-last-update` retrieves the last update timestamp from Vercel KV.
